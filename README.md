# Simulate Secure Multi-Site Infrastructure

## Introduction & Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise Linux-based (Debian 13) which focusses on security, centralization, load-balancing which is merge scenario where to geographically separated for coporate domains: (Headquarters) wsmb2026.my, (Server Farm) itnsa.my to establish reliable communication channels.

## Project Objective

 To architect and deploy a production-ready, multi-site enterprise infrastructure that securely integrates two distinct corporate domains using simulated internet using Public ISP. 

1. Utilizing critical thinking to solve core infrastructure challenges.

2. Enforcing a Zero-Trust security perimeter.

3. Mitigating single points of failure which have redundacy for multiple services also achieve rapid scaling for enterprises.

## Technical Architecture & Implementation

 This topology outlines resilent and enterprise production multi-site using 3 multiple sites
 ### Headquarters: ** Act as the main corporate network hosting core identity services and internal user endpoint using Active Directory concepts. 
 1. Network and IP Management
 2. firewall?
 3. Central User Login
 4. File Sharing

 ### Server Farm/ DMZ
 1. Smart Web Traffic to secure the network from redirecting all the way to the backend server
 2. DNS servers that automatically sync with primary and secondary DNS to mitigate any outage happen
 3. Setup and securing enterprise email using postfix dovecot package using SSL/TLS form digital certificates
 4. Ansible was used automated code to setup and configure servers instantly while also reduced human errors.

 ### Public ISP Transit: Act as untrusted public internet connecting all corporate sites 
 1. All the edge routers were using OSPF routing protocol only for public subnets to route public traffic across the network.
 2. Implementing GRE over IPsec both edge routers using certifcate-based and placed on trusted root certicate authorities on each servers.
 3. Also block all untrusted incoming internet traffic by default and only explicitly allowed internal traffic
